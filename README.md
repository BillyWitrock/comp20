## Billy Witrock's Private GitHub repository

1. The purpose of this Git repository is first to submit work easily and second to keep track of version control.

2. My favorite lab or assignment was the MBTA assignment because it was the first one that I felt that I was actually making a website.

3. I feel that I have grown a lot during this class.

4. The  most important things I have learned in this class is how to use JavaScript.
    * We used JavaScript client-side to make our MBTA website
    * We used JavaScript server-side to make our 2048 Game server

5. Now that I have finished the class, the one topic I would like to dive deeper into is, the inner-workings of databases.
